# practice-contracts

Welcome. This is a public repository housing a selection of practice and sample contracts that I have developed or worked with whilst learning Solidity and how to interact with blockchains. The intention behind this repository is primarily to chart my progress and development over time.

As such, please always take care and be aware that this code is produced by an amateur, without the intention to be deployed into a live environment or to be used for operations of significant risk or value. Care should always be taken when review and/or working with these files, and make sure to always do your own research.

Thanks!

Jack
