# Asset.sol

Iteration on Currency.sol, expanding with an interface (IAsset.sol) to allow external contracts to interface directly to mint the ERC-20 asset.

Name changed to Asset.sol to reflect designation of "Assets" in the ERC-4626 standard. Currency.sol was always intended to be a sample ERC-20 to be used in vaults and other more complicated financial contracts.
